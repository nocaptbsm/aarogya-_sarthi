## üìñ The Challenge: SIH Problem Statement

This project is our dedicated solution to the following challenge posed by the Government of Odisha.

* **ID:** `ID25049`
* **Title:** AI-Driven Public Health Chatbot for Disease Awareness.
* **Organization:** Government of Odisha
* **Department:** Electronics & IT Department
* **Description:** Create a multilingual AI chatbot to educate rural and semi-urban populations about preventive healthcare, disease symptoms, and vaccination schedules. The chatbot should integrate with government health databases and provide real-time alerts for outbreaks.

## üí° Our Solution: Aarogya Sarthi

**Aarogya Sarthi** is a purpose-built AI health companion designed to empower every citizen of Odisha with instant, reliable, and accessible health information. We deliver this through the platforms they already know and trust‚Äî**WhatsApp and SMS**‚Äîin their native language, serving as a true digital health `Sarthi` (charioteer).

### ‚ú® Our Unique Approach

* **1. Zero Friction Onboarding:** By leveraging WhatsApp & SMS, we eliminate the digital literacy barriers and app-download fatigue common in rural areas.
* **2. Hyper-Local Intelligence:** Our AI is trained on data specific to Odisha's health landscape, understanding local dialects (Odia), regional diseases, and the state‚Äôs healthcare network.
* **3. A Beacon of Trust:** In an era of misinformation, our chatbot integrates directly with official government health databases, ensuring every piece of information is authenticated and reliable.
* **4. Engineered for State-Wide Scale:** Our architecture is not just a prototype; it's a production-ready system built with Docker and Kubernetes to serve millions of users reliably during critical public health events.
